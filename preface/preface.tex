% Complex Systems : Preface

\chapter*{Preface}

\epigraph{I think the next century will be the century of complexity}{Stephen W. Hawking}

It is a truism to say that we live in a world of increasing complexity. If we look around us we see different types of systems (physical, biological, cognitive, social) whose structure and behavior are hard to formalize and understand. For example,\\

 three body problem\\
 immune system\\
 mind\\
 city\\
 
We need a new way of thinking, a new kind of science. That is the goal of the new Complex Systems Science.\\


In this text we compile some notes concerning the course on Complex Systems given at the Department of Informatics Engineering of the University of Coimbra. There are some recent books on the subject (see \cite{Sayama2015}, \cite{Barabasi2015}) and these notes do not intent to replace them. The course started in 2015 and we decided to start writing these notes because when you write your are forced to make clear your understanding, and in this process you faced your own difficulties in the subject.
